# Unphysical-String-Simulator
Potentially one of the first unphysical string simulators in the world

This simulator takes inputs from users and inputs it to the ODESolver. To create this unphysical simulator, the
principles of a string simulator had to be extrapolated to a potential infinite sized node. Then the interaction
and mass value variation was added to the string simulator. This was followed by adding realistic mass and length
values and reducing user choice to reduce operation complexity and ease the users' understanding of value variations
and its effect on sounds which they are familiar with - i.e. guitars.
